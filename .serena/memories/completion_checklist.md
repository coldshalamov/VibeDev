# Task Completion Checklist

Before finalizing a task:
1. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running and healthy.
2. Run relevant tests (`pytest` for backend, `npm run test` for UI).
3. Check for linting errors in the UI (`npm run lint`).
4. Commit changes with a descriptive message.
5. Push to GitHub (`git push origin main`).
6. Verify visibility on the GitHub repository.
