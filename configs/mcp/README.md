# MCP Config Templates

These are **templates** for configuring the VibeDev MCP server in different agents/clients.

The MCP protocol is common, but config schemas and file locations vary by client.
Use these as copy/paste starting points.

- Windows: `mcpServers.vibedev.windows.json`
- POSIX: `mcpServers.vibedev.posix.json`
